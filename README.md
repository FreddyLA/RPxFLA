RPx
==========================================

This is an automatic theorem prover [RPx][RPx] for first order logic without equality. 

The TPTP Parser and the clausifier is based on Metis development version a0e808d746fa1f14cf944bed0d395d0df991320d

Install

Installing requires the [Poly/ML][PolyML] compiler, as well as standard system tools including GNU Make and Perl.

Build
-----

    make init

    make polyml

The executable can then be found at

    bin/polyml/rpxprover

Test
----

A simple test is to display a usage message:

    path/to/rpxprover --help

Troubleshoot
------------

You can use

    make clean

to clean out any object files.

RPx relies on the TPTP Parser and the clausifier from the Metis theorem prover, which is due to Joe Leslie-Hurd.
The file RPx.sml was generated by Isabelle2018. It contains code generated from theory (.thy) files by us
(Anders Schlichtkrull, Jasmin Christian Blanchette, Dmitriy Traytel -- the authors of RPx), as well
as from theory files loaded from the Isabelle distribution (https://isabelle.in.tum.de), the Archive 
of Formal Proofs (https://www.isa-afp.org) and IsaFoR (http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/isafor/).
